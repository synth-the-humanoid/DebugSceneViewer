# DebugSceneViewer

# What is it?

A basic modification for Kingdom Hearts Final Mix using KHMI(https://github.com/synth-the-humanoid/KHMI). After running, it sets the scene flag for all rooms to 25, which enables debug artifacts in some rooms. If you save after using this, **YOU WILL BRICK YOUR SAVE**.

# How to use?

Get KHMI from https://github.com/synth-the-humanoid/KHMI. It doesn't matter if you use the CLI or the GUI. After downloading the desired version from the LatestRelease folder of KHMI's repo, download the .dll from this repo's LatestRelease folder and place it in the included mods directory of your KHMI install. Run once and it will immediately update all scene flags.
